Module 3 Challenge - Python
UofT SCS Data Analytics Bootcamp's - Data Analytics Boot Camp - Assignment 3 (Python)

In this assignment two different project are given, one of them is a financial report of a company and the other one is the election results. We will try to make a simple and professional report for each project, by using the python script and based on data files have given in a csv file and for each case with a heavy dataset file located in a resource folder. 
PyBank 
In this Challenge, we created a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. There is a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
Our script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The results will print into terminal and also will send to a text file for review and reporting.  
Your analysis should align with the following results:
PyPoll
In this Challenge, the created python script make modernize the vote-counting process of an election.
The script by using a csv file of a given data set of an election called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". We will try to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
